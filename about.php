    <h2 id="title">About Us</h2>
    <h4 class="directions">Project ABCD was created in the 2019-2020 school year by the current SILC CS320 (PHP) class students. Each of us have contibuted to the creation of the wedsite by completing one functionality individually. We have then pushed our updates to Github where there is a ongoing Project ABCD application. We used GitHub to download the master baseline and to ingegrate our changes. This year we also created our own webadress using Blue Host. Enjoy! <br> </h4>
